# Convex-Optimization
This is a repository created for Alexandre d'Aspremont's class on convex optimization. 

This repository includes a notebook with the implementation of solvers for both primal and dual of the well-known
Support Vector Machine problem. Here we use barrier method combined with Newton's method. We test our solver with 
the classical iris dataset.
